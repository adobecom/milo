        <p>We’ve been talking lately about how sites can consume Milo blocks, features, and utilities. This is also
          highly relevant for existing sites that already have a significant inventory of blocks. I think we have landed
          on a model that will work well for most and has the fewest drawbacks.</p>
        <p>We have a few key pillars that we are measuring a solution against:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Milo-centric. We want it to be painful or borderline impossible to override a block provided by Milo.</li>
          <li>We do want to allow some highly specialized blocks to be built directly in a project. This is especially
            important for sites that may be run by vendors.</li>
          <li>We do not want to maintain a list or registry of blocks. When solving this problem, it’s easy to jump to,
            “Just have a list of which blocks to pull from Milo.” Beyond about 20 blocks, that list starts to get way to
            long and provide less and less value.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>For #1 above, we need to accept the realities of where we are starting today. Milo only has a few blocks
          right now. This is in comparison to mature sites that may have 20+ of their own blocks today. It doesn’t make
          sense for these projects to default to Milo in the beginning. This means we are going to bifurcate our
          consumers into two buckets:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Milo first</li>
          <li>Site first</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The idea is that when a site finds a block, it will see if Milo has code to make that block work, and if Milo
          doesn’t have it, it will look to the site. For the second, it will look to the site first.</p>
        <p>Here’s the fun bit: we are not maintaining a list of blocks anywhere. If Milo returns a 404, the block loader
          will fallback to asking the site for the block code. This sounds good in theory, but we need to make sure this
          404 fallback method will continue to work for us from a Lighthouse perspective.</p>
        <p>We don’t want to start out of the gate with a ton of 404s. It’s important to recognize the realities of
          today. A site like <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/">Blog</a> should be site-first. They have a much larger
          block inventory than Milo does and we don’t want them throwing a ton of 404s. A site like <a
            href="https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/photography/hub/guides/manual-or-automatic-dslr-aperture">FedPub</a>,
          which only has 2 blocks total, should be Milo-first.</p>
        <p>As we migrate more and more blocks off Blog and other sites like it, we can move Blog to being Milo-first. If
          we find the 404 model isn’t work, we will then evaluate if we do need sites to maintain a lookup of
          <em>their</em> own blocks.
