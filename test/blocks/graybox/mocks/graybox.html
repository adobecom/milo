      <p>That's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned! Ha ha! You fool! You fell victim to one
        of the classic blunders - The most famous of which is "never get involved in a land war in Asia" - but only
        slightly less well-known is this: "Never go against a Sicilian when death is on the line"! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
        Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha...</p>

      <p>You're the Dread Pirate Roberts, admit it. How may do you think you could handle? You mean you wish to
        surrender to me? Very well, I accept. But how can you be sure? Will this do? You truly love each other and so
        you might have been truly happy. Not one couple in a century has that chance, no matter what the story books
        say.</p>

            <p>“3D is a crucial part of how we explore the brand in a digital workflow. Adobe Substance 3D Stager takes
              the barrier of entry out of 3D design by enabling us to skip physical mockups and look at feedback faster.
              We’ve been able to bring digital design entirely in-house.”</p>

      <p>The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. Don't try to frighten us with
        your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the
        stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort. I find your lack of faith
        disturbing. Enough of this! Vader, release him! As you wish.</p>
      <p>Did you hear that? They've shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for sure. This is madness! We're
        doomed! There'll be no escape for the Princess this time. What's that? Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you? At
        last! Where have you been? They're heading in this direction.</p>
