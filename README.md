## Tooling

### NPM (Recommended)
While milo *does not* require NPM to function, you will need to install npm packages (`npm install`) to:

1. Lint
2. Test
3. Run libs

### Recommendations
You can use any text editor or IDE of your choice, but milo is highly optimized for VS Code. Milo provides recommended extensions (use the filters) and debugging tools.

## Libs
If you want to see how your local milo changes impact a consuming site you will need to work on a different port.

```
npm run libs  
```
Milo will run at:
```
http://localhost:6456
```
You can then test any of the following:
```
http://localhost:3000/?milolibs=local (local code, stage content)

https://main--project--owner.hlx.page/?milolibs=local (prod code, stage content)

https://main--project--owner.hlx.live/?milolibs=local (prod code, prod content)

https://feat-branch--project--owner.hlx.page/?milolibs=local (feature code, stage content)
```

## Testing
```sh
npm run test
```
or:
```sh
npm run test:watch
```
### Coverage
`npm run test:watch` can give misleading coverage reports. Use `npm run test` for accurate coverage reporting.
