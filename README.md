See the wiki for [more detailed instructions](https://github.com/adobecom/milo/wiki/Getting-started) on how to get started writing features for Milo.

## Tooling

### NPM (Recommended)
While milo *does not* require NPM to function, you will need to install npm packages (`npm install`) to:

1. Lint
2. Test
3. Run libs

### Recommendations
You can use any text editor or IDE of your choice, but milo is highly optimized for VS Code. Milo provides recommended extensions (use the filters) and debugging tools.

## Libs
If you want to see how your local milo changes impact a consuming site you will need to work on a different port.

```
npm run libs
```
Milo will run at:
```
http://localhost:6456
```
You can then test any of the following:
```
http://localhost:3000/?milolibs=local (local code, stage content)

https://main--project--owner.hlx.page/?milolibs=local (prod code, stage content)

https://main--project--owner.hlx.live/?milolibs=local (prod code, prod content)

https://feat-branch--project--owner.hlx.page/?milolibs=local (feature code, stage content)
```

## Testing
### Unit Testing
```sh
npm run test
```
or:
```sh
npm run test:watch
```
### Coverage
`npm run test:watch` can give misleading coverage reports. Use `npm run test` for accurate coverage reporting.

### Nala E2E UI Testing
-----

#### 1. Running Nala Tests
Nala tests are run using the `npm run nala <env> [options]` command:

```sh
npm run nala <env> [options]
```
```sh
# env: [local | libs | branch | stage | etc ] default: local

# options:
  - browser=<chrome|firefox|webkit>    # Browser to use (default: chrome)
  - device=<desktop|mobile>            # Device (default: desktop)
  - test=<.test.js>                    # Specific test file to run (runs all tests in the file)
  - -g, --g=<@tag>                     # Tag to filter tests by annotations ex: @test1 @accordion @marquee
  - mode=<headless|ui|debug|headed>    # Mode (default: headless)
  - config=<config-file>               # Configuration file (default: Playwright default)
  - project=<project-name>             # Project configuration (default: milo-live-chromium)
  - milolibs=<local|prod|feature|any|> # Milolibs?=<env> 

```
#### 2. Nala Help Command:
To view examples of how to use Nala commands with various options, you can run
```sh
npm run nala help
```

#### ⚠️ Important Note
- **Debug and UI Mode Caution**: When using `debug` or `ui` mode, it is recommended to run only a single test using annotations (e.g., `@test1`). Running multiple tests in these modes (e.g., `npm run nala local mode=debug` or `mode=ui`) will launch a separate browser or debugger window for each test, which can quickly become resource-intensive and challenging to manage.

- **Tip**: To effectively watch or debug, focus on one test at a time to avoid opening excessive browser instances or debugger windows.
