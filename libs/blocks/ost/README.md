## Development

To prevent IMS from redirecting to sign-in page and back,
so to check OST in a PR branch when test URL is not supported by IMS,
perform the following:
- navigate to adobe.com,
- open devtools console,
- execute `copy(adobeIMS.getAccessToken().token)`,
- add token to OST URL querystring, e.g.: `https://mwpw-127984--milo--vladen.hlx.page/tools/ost?token=eyJhb...`
