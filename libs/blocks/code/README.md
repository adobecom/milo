# Code

The `code` block allows you create a formatted block of programming code, complete with language specific syntax highlighting.

## Use

Paste code into block and format code as monospaced text. Block will not render and error if text is not monospaced. See "Tips" for more details.

## Variants

### Language variants

Any variants not included below are assumed to be language variants, e.g. `javascript`.

Use the `wrap` variant to wrap the text.

### Size variants

- `large`
- `medium` (default)
- `small`

### Theme variants

- `light` (default)
- `dark`

## Tips

The text within the `code` block _must_ be monospaced but formatting it this way is not always rendered as `<pre><code>` by Franklin.

If pasting to Microsoft Word, first copy monospaced text and then paste using `shift-command-v`, which should remove formatting, but retain spacing. Then select text and assign any monospaced font.
